			Thanos, also known as the Mad Titan, is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. He was created by writer/artist Jim Starlin and first appeared in "Iron Man" #55 in 1973. Thanos has become one of Marvel's most significant and complex villains, known for his relentless pursuit of power and his quest to reshape the universe in his own image.
<br><br>
Thanos is a member of the alien race known as the Titans, hailing from the moon of Saturn called Titan. He possesses superhuman strength, durability, and longevity due to his enhanced physiology. Thanos is also highly intelligent and a strategic mastermind. He is often depicted as a towering and physically imposing figure, with purple skin and a distinctive ridged chin.
<br><br>
The central driving force behind Thanos' character is his obsession with death and his desire to gain ultimate power. He is infatuated with Mistress Death, the personification of death in the Marvel Universe, and seeks to impress her by committing acts of mass genocide. Thanos believes that the universe is plagued by overpopulation and limited resources, and he seeks to restore balance by wiping out half of all life. This motivation leads him to assemble the Infinity Stones, immensely powerful artifacts that grant control over various aspects of existence.
<br><br>
One of the most significant storylines involving Thanos is the "Infinity Gauntlet" storyline. In this storyline, Thanos successfully acquires all six Infinity Stones, including the Mind, Power, Reality, Soul, Space, and Time Stones, and fuses them into a powerful glove called the Infinity Gauntlet. With the Gauntlet, Thanos gains god-like powers and becomes virtually unstoppable. He eradicates half of all life in the universe with a snap of his fingers, resulting in a catastrophic event known as "The Snap." This storyline has been adapted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in the films "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018) and "Avengers: Endgame" (2019).
<br><br>
Thanos has clashed with numerous Marvel heroes over the years, including the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the cosmic entities of the Marvel Universe. He has been a recurring antagonist in many comic book events and crossovers, often bringing together heroes from different corners of the Marvel Universe to stop his destructive ambitions.
<br><br>
Thanos' complex and tragic character has made him one of the most compelling villains in Marvel's roster. Despite his immense power and ruthless actions, some interpretations of Thanos present him as a sympathetic figure who genuinely believes he is doing what is necessary for the greater good. This complexity has contributed to his enduring popularity among readers and audiences alike.
