In his original origin story, Dr. Otto Octavius was a respected and highly intelligent nuclear physicist. During an experiment gone wrong, his mechanical tentacle apparatus, which he designed to manipulate hazardous materials, became fused to his body. This accident also caused a mental breakdown, leading Octavius to adopt the persona of Doctor Octopus. The mechanical arms, or "tentacles," are permanently attached to his back and give him superhuman strength, the ability to climb walls, and incredible dexterity.
